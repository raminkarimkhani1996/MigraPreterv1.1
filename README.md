# MigraPreterv1.1

I made updates on the MigraPreter tool and published it as "version 1.1". With MigraPreter, you can create an EXE file to migrate the process by entering the ID value of a desired process. Migration to an arbitrary process could prevent dangerous migration of LSASS.EXE, CSRSS.EXE, and WINLOGON.EXE.
